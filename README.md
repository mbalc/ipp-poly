# ipp-poly

The following text is cited from a README prepared by Piotr StyczyÅ„ski to his implementation of that task. Thanks for sharing this translation and explanation. 

Exercise

This project is based on exercise we had to do on Warsaw University, Poland on the Individual Programistic Project subject.

Task

The exercise was to design and implement:

Provide dynamically-allocated lists implementation - pre-exercise

Polynomial handling library in pure C99 - part no. 1

Interactive calculator for that library - part no. 2

Implement additional functionality and provide basic unit tests - part no. 3

Project structure

The project provides:

library src/poly.h for handling polynomials

additional helper libraries like dynamically allocated arrays etc.

interactive calculator src/calc_poly.c

unit tests in tests/

Building

To build do the following:

Create release folder - mkdir release

Go to that folder - cd release

Generate makefiles - cmake ..

Build everything - make

Optionally run tests - make test

Optionally generate documentation (needs Doxygen to be installed) - make doc

Optionally clean everything - make clean

Polynomial library

All the documentation is provided in header files.

There you've got example usage of the library:

  #include "poly.h"

  int main(void) {

    Poly p = PolyC(4);
    // Create constant polynomial
    // p(x) = 4

    Poly q = PolyP( PolyC(1), 2 );
    // Create polynomial that consists of
    // variable square multiplied by
    // coefficient 1
    // q(x) = 1*x^2

    // As you may see the coefficients that are placed
    // next to variables may be other polynomials
    // (polynomials from other variable)

    Poly r = PolyP( PolyP( PolyC(1), 2 ), 3 );
    // In this example
    // r(x,y) = (1*y^2)*(x^3)

    // Now you can do arithemtic operations on them
    // for example addition:
    Poly sum = PolyAdd(&p, &q);
    // sum(x) = 4 + x^2
    // If you are not sure what would happen if we sum
    // q and r then we say that the result is
    //
    // q(x) + r(x,y) = 1*x^2 + (1*y^2)*(x^3)
    // that is:
    //   x^2 + (y^2)(x^3)
    //

    // Or evalue at specific point:
    Poly rAtTwo = PolyAt(&r, 2);
    // Now we assume the first variable is equal to 2
    // So we calculate r(x,y) for x->2
    // rAtTwo = r(2,y) = (2^3)*y^2 = 8*y^2

    // You can print them nicely:
    PolyPrint(&rAtTwo);
    // ^ Do it yourself and see what the output is

    // After everything we must free them all
    PolyDestroy(&p);
    PolyDestroy(&q);
    PolyDestroy(&r);
    PolyDestroy(&sum);
    PolyDestroy(&rAtTwo);

Polynomial calculator

The calulator resides in src/calc_poly.c.

It reads data from stdin line by line and:

If the line starts with lower/upper case letter then it's assumed
to be an input command.

Otherwise the input is parsed as a polynomial
The format of the polynomial is
(COEFF_1,EXP_1)+(COEFF_2,EXP_2)+...+(COEFF_N,EXP_N)
Where pair (COEFF_N,EXP_N) represents single monomial (COEFF_N)*x^(EXP_N)
The coefficients can be numbers:
(1,3)+(2,4) -> x^3 + 2x^4
Or polynomials (in this case they depend on other variable):
((1,3)+(2,4),2)+(1,3) -> (x^3 + 2x^4)*y^2 + y^3
can also contain monomials with the same exponent:
(1,2)+(1,2) -> 2x^2
Or can be just numbers:
42 -> constant polynomial 42

All the polynomials are parsed and placed on top of the stack. Then you can call one or more of the given operations

to modify the stack contents:

Command	Parameters	Required stack size	Description
ZERO		0	Pushes zero const polynomial onto stack
IS_COEFF		1	Checks if the stack top is a constant polynomial?
IS_ZERO		1	Checks if the stack top is a polynomial equal to 0?
CLONE		1	Copies the polynomial on top of the stack and places it on the top.
ADD		2	Adds two polynomials from the top of the stack.
Then puts the result on the stack top.
MUL		2	Multiplies two polynomials from the top of the stack.
Then puts the result on the stack top.
NEG		1	Changes the sign of the polynomial on the top of the stack.
SUB		2	Substracts two polynomials from the top of the stack.
Then puts the result on the stack top.
IS_EQ		2	Checks if two top-most polynomials are equal.
DEG		1	Checks the degree of the top-most polynomial.
Degree of the polynomial is a highest exponent of variable
encountered in the polynomial (assuming all variables are the
same one).
E.g. degree(x^2 + yx^2) = 3
DEG_BY	index	1	Checks the degree of the top-most polynomial
with respect to the given variable. Variables are indexed from 0
(0 means the main variable of polynomial).

E.g.
DegBy( ((1,2),3), 0 ) = DegBy( x^2 * y^3, 0 ) = 3
DegBy( ((1,2),3), 1 ) = DegBy( x^2 * y^3, 1 ) = 2
AT	value	1	Evaluates the top-most polynomial in specified point
and put it into stack.
The polynomial is evalued for MAIN_VARIABLE=[value] where
MAIN_VARIABLE is variable with index 0.

E.g.
At( ((1,2),3), 0 ) = At( x^2 * y^3, 0 ) = 0
At( (1,2), 2 ) = At( x^2, 2 ) = 4

The result of this command is always a polynomial of degree one smaller
than the polynomial given.
PRINT		1	Prints the top-most polynomial.
POP		1	Pops the top-most polynomial from the stack.
POW	exp	1	Calculates the top-most polynomial power and push into the
stack. Obviously exp can be only a number!
COMPOSE	count	count+1	Takes top-most polynomail from the stack.
(We will call it P)
Then take count polynomials from the stack (let's call them Q1, Q2 ...).
Then we know that P = C_1*x_1^E_1 + C_2*x_2^E_2 + ...
so we substitute
x_1 -> Q1
x_2 -> Q2
etc.
if the x_n has got no matching QN then we assume x_n -> 0

Then we put result of such substitution onto the stack.
DUMP		0	Prints the stack contents.
CLEAN		0	Clears the stack entinerely.
EXIT		0	Force exits the calculator.
